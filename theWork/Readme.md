# Voice Assistant Based on Llama3

This project is a voice assistant script running on Windows 11, utilizing various libraries such as `llama_chat`, `speech_recognition`, `datetime`, `gtts`, `pygame`, `threading`, `queue`, and `time`.

## Initialization

The script starts by importing necessary libraries and initializing the `pygame` mixer for audio playback.

```python
from llama_chat import chat_with_llama
import speech_recognition as sr
from datetime import date
from gtts import gTTS
from io import BytesIO
from pygame import mixer 
import threading
import queue
import time

mixer.init()
```
