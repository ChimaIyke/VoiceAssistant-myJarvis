## Introduction to Model training

Large Language Models (LLM), like OpenAI's GPT-4 or Google's PaLM, have taken the world of artificial intelligence by storm. Yet most companies don't currently have the ability to train these models and are completely reliant on only a handful of large tech firms as providers of the technology.

**Why we train our own LLMs?**

- One of the most common questions for the AI today give rise to why we chose to train our own LLM model, there are plenty of reasons why we decide to train our own LLMs for our system recommendation project, ranging from data privacy and security to increased control over updates and improvement on already existing LLMs model. Our project is primarily about customizing  and reducing dependency on already existing LLMs thereby making our model more unique to our project parameters. 
- Training a custom model allows us to tailor it to our specific needs and requirements, including platform-specific capabilities, terminology, and context that will not be well-covered in general-purpose models like GPT-4 or even code-specific models like Codex. For example, our models are trained to do a better job with specific web-based languages that are popular, including Javascript , python, react (JSX) and Typescript React (TSX).

**Reduced dependency:** While we'll always use the right model based on the task at hand, we believe there are benefits to being less dependent on only a handful of AI providers. This is true not just for our project but for the broader developer community. 
**Cost efficiency:** Although costs will continue to go down, LLMs are still prohibitively expensive for use amongst the global developer community. 

**Dataset**

•	Source a suitable dataset that includes paired text and image data.
•	Ensure the dataset is diverse enough to cover various scenarios and contexts.

**Model Architecture**

**Model Architecture:** Utilize an existing model architecture compatible with text-to-image conversion, such as LLM2. LLM2 is a powerful large language model designed for multimodal tasks, leveraging advanced neural network techniques to process and generate both text and image data. For this project, LLM2 will be fine-tuned to handle text-to-image conversion by training on a dataset containing paired text and images. The model's transformer architecture, equipped with attention mechanisms, will allow it to learn the intricate relationships between textual descriptions and visual representations. By embedding both text and image data into a shared latent space, LLM2 can generate high-quality images from text and accurately reconstruct text from images, achieving seamless bidirectional conversion.

- Integrate the model with Hugging Face for training and deployment.
- Integrating the LLM2 model with Hugging Face for training and deployment involves several steps to ensure a seamless workflow:

**Environment Setup:**

Install necessary libraries: transformers, datasets, and torch (or tensorflow).

Configure GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) support for efficient training if available.



**Evaluation and Metrics:**

- Implement evaluation metrics to monitor the performance of the model during and after training.

- Use metrics like BLEU for text generation quality and FID for image quality.
